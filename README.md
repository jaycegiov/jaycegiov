## About
This repository serves as my experimentation and working hub.  
It is where I build, test, and refine projects that help me develop new skills in finance, technology, and data analysis.  
The aim is to illustrate both the skills I have already mastered and the areas I am actively working on as part of my learning journey.

## Focus Areas
- **Financial Modelling**: Valuation techniques (DCF, Comps, Precedents), Venture Capital-specific models (cap tables, option pools, liquidation waterfalls).  
- **Data Analytics**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), R, Excel-based modelling.  
- **Venture Capital Analysis**: Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), competitive landscape mapping, portfolio construction, unit economics, and investment thesis writing.  
- **Technology & Tools**: Git, SQL, Streamlit for simple dashboards, APIs (Companies House, ONS, SEC).  

## Projects Backlog
The repositories pinned here represent practical applications of the above areas:
- **VC Deal-Sourcing Engine (Python + Companies House API)** – automated pipeline to identify early-stage companies.  
- **Market Map & TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis** – structured framework for market opportunity evaluation.  
- **Unit Economics & Cohort Retention Model** – subscription-based company analysis.  
- **Cap Table & SAFE Modelling** – multi-round dilution and waterfall scenarios.  
- **Fund Portfolio Simulation** – Monte Carlo modelling of reserves and returns.  

## Purpose
This GitHub portfolio is not just a showcase, but also a structured record of my professional development.  
Each project has been designed to mirror the types of tasks required in venture capital and investment analysis roles.
